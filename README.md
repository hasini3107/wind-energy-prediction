# 🍃Wind Energy Prediction

Wind energy prediction is the process of estimating the amount of electrical power that can be generated from wind at a particular place and time. Wind is a natural and renewable resource, but it is not constant because wind speed and direction change frequently. When wind flows over the blades of a wind turbine, it rotates them and produces electricity through a generator. The amount of energy produced mainly depends on wind speed, air density, and the design of the wind turbine.

Wind energy prediction is important for planning and managing power generation efficiently. It helps power operators maintain a balance between electricity supply and demand, reduce energy losses, and ensure grid stability. By predicting wind power in advance, renewable energy systems can operate more reliably and support sustainable and clean energy production.
